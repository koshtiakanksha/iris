## Iris Classification: A Data Science Exploration

**Aim:** Classify Iris species using data science techniques.

**Objectives:**

* Explore the Iris dataset (Sepal & Petal measurements) to understand its characteristics.
* Develop and evaluate machine learning models for accurate classification.

**Procedure:**

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Analyzed the Iris dataset using visualizations. Applied standardization and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to prepare the data.
2. **Model Development & Evaluation:** Implemented various classification algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) with hyperparameter optimization. Evaluated model performance using accuracy.

**Findings:**

* Visualization revealed distinct clusters for each Iris species based on Petal measurements.
* All models achieved good performance, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy (100%).

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully employed data analysis and machine learning to classify Iris flowers. While all models performed well, XGBoost emerged as the most accurate. Future exploration could involve applying these techniques to more complex datasets.
